      "Transcript": "As someone who has taught sign language for many years using traditional methods, I was initially skeptical about VR technology. However, the results have been undeniable. Students are learning sign vocabulary faster and retaining it better. The 3D visualization helps students understand the spatial aspects of signing that are difficult to convey through 2D materials. The virtual environments provide context that makes learning more meaningful. My main concern was that technology might replace human interaction, but I've found it actually enhances our face-to-face teaching. Students come to class more prepared and confident. The learning curve for educators was steep, but the student outcomes justify the effort.",
