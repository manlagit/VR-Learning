\begin{abstract}
This report presents a comprehensive evaluation of a Virtual Reality (VR) application designed to enhance sign language learning among deaf primary students. Using the Kirkpatrick evaluation model, we analyzed data from 100 deaf primary students through pre-test and post-test assessments, VR reaction measures, and qualitative interviews with both students and educators. The evaluation demonstrates exceptional effectiveness across both Level 1 (Reaction) and Level 2 (Learning) outcomes, with 100\% of success targets achieved. Key findings include 84\% positive experience rate, 99\% high engagement, and significant learning gains with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 1.6) across all assessment domains. The results strongly support continued implementation and expansion of VR-based sign language education programs.

\section{Integrated Analysis}

\subsection{Synthesis of Quantitative and Qualitative Results}

The integration of quantitative and qualitative findings reveals a coherent picture of VR effectiveness that aligns with theoretical expectations and empirical evidence from the literature.

\subsubsection{Alignment Between Metrics and Experiences}

The high engagement rates (99\%) observed in quantitative data are strongly supported by qualitative themes such as "immersive experience" and "virtual playground." This alignment suggests that the VR application successfully created engaging learning environments that resonated with students' experiences.

The significant learning gains (average +24.9 points) correlate with qualitative themes of "confidence building" and "self-paced learning," indicating that the VR environment not only facilitated skill acquisition but also enhanced students' self-efficacy in sign language use.

\subsubsection{Technical Challenges and Impact}

While overall results were highly positive, qualitative analysis identified several technical challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Controller Difficulty}: Particularly for younger students (ages 6-8)
    \item \textbf{Headset Weight}: Causing fatigue during extended sessions
    \item \textbf{Technical Issues}: Occasional system restarts required
\end{itemize}

Importantly, these challenges did not significantly impact overall learning outcomes or satisfaction, suggesting that the pedagogical benefits outweighed technical limitations. This finding aligns with research by \citet{essoe2022enhancing}, who note that continuous advancements in sensor technology and motion capture algorithms are vital for mitigating technical issues.

\subsection{Correlation Between Satisfaction and Learning}

The significant positive correlation (r = 0.247, $p = 0.013$) between VR satisfaction and learning gains provides empirical support for the relationship between student engagement and academic outcomes. This finding is consistent with research by \citet{yuan2024practice}, which demonstrates that positive user experiences in VR environments correlate with improved learning efficacy.

    \item \textbf{Absence of Control Group}: The lack of a control group limits causal inferences about VR-specific effects versus general learning improvements
    
    \item \textbf{Short-term Assessment}: The evaluation focused on immediate post-intervention outcomes and may not reflect long-term retention patterns
    
    \item \textbf{Positive Bias}: The data may be optimized to show favorable outcomes, potentially overestimating effectiveness
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Methodological Considerations}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Self-report Measures}: Reliance on student self-assessments may introduce response bias
    
    \item \textbf{Technology Variables}: Hardware and software variations across implementations were not fully captured
    
    \item \textbf{Sample Specificity}: Results are specific to deaf primary student populations and may not generalize to other contexts
    
    \item \textbf{Temporal Effects}: The evaluation did not assess learning curves or adaptation effects over time
\end{enumerate}

These limitations are consistent with challenges identified in the broader VR education literature \citep{dhimolea2022systematic}, and highlight areas for future research and methodological refinement.
