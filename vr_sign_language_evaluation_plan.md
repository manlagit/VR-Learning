# Evaluation Plan for Assessing the Effectiveness of the VR Application in Sign Language Learning

## Executive Summary

This evaluation plan outlines a comprehensive methodology for assessing the effectiveness of a Virtual Reality (VR) application designed to enhance sign language learning among deaf primary students. The evaluation utilizes the Kirkpatrick evaluation model, focusing on Level 1 (Reaction) and Level 2 (Learning) outcomes, with data collected from 100 deaf primary students through pre-test and post-test questionnaires and interviews.

## 1. Evaluation Framework

### 1.1 Theoretical Foundation
The evaluation is grounded in the Kirkpatrick Four-Level Training Evaluation Model:
- **Level 1 (Reaction)**: Students' satisfaction and engagement with the VR application
- **Level 2 (Learning)**: Knowledge acquisition and skill development in sign language
- **Level 3 (Behavior)**: Application of learned skills (future consideration)
- **Level 4 (Results)**: Long-term impact on communication abilities (future consideration)

### 1.2 Evaluation Objectives
**Primary Objectives:**
1. Assess student reactions to the VR sign language learning application
2. Measure learning outcomes and skill acquisition in sign language
3. Identify factors that contribute to effective VR-based sign language learning
4. Provide recommendations for application improvement

**Secondary Objectives:**
1. Compare pre-test and post-test performance metrics
2. Analyze qualitative feedback from students and educators
3. Evaluate the usability and accessibility of the VR application
4. Assess the pedagogical effectiveness of VR technology in special education

## 2. Research Questions

### 2.1 Primary Research Questions
1. How do deaf primary students react to the VR sign language learning application in terms of engagement, satisfaction, and perceived usefulness?
2. What measurable learning outcomes can be attributed to the use of the VR application?
3. How does student performance change from pre-test to post-test after using the VR application?

### 2.2 Secondary Research Questions
1. What are the key factors that influence student engagement with the VR application?
2. How do educators perceive the effectiveness of the VR tool as a learning aid?
3. What technical or pedagogical improvements could enhance the application's effectiveness?
4. Are there demographic or individual differences that affect learning outcomes?
